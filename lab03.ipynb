    "\n",
    "General Lab Instructions:\n",
    "1. All assignments will be submitted through Canvas. If you submit multiple times, the most recent submission will be graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You will typically explain your code from the last lab to the instructor at the beginning of the next lab to receive your full marks and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you work with other people, list all of your names on the assignment. Each assignment will specify how many others you can work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Please review the collage’s plagiarism policies. As a general rule, copy/paste should never be used for any code. Ever. You may discuss topics with other students and reference online materials, but the final assignment must be written by the student. If you reference materials/people besides the textbook/instructor then cite this in a file contributions.txt. Full citations are not necessary, a bullet point list of the materials/people that you references is suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Code will be graded for functionality as well as quality. This means code that should be easy to read with descriptive variable names and appropriate comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You should aim to stick to the concepts we have already covered in class. For example, do not use ”if statements” on assignment 1 since it was not covered in lecture 1. If you have studied programming elsewhere then it is tempting to jump ahead, but full marks will only be given to assignments that are focused on this course’s content.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Code that cannot run successively in Python 3 will receive a zero. Make sure you are using the correct python version and allow yourself enough time for thorough testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. At the start of each assignment will be a list of the required files for submission. All files should be com- pressed in one zip folder named <studentnumber>_<yourname >_LAB < number >_CPSC110.zip. For example: 21870110_LUKESKYWALKER_LAB01_CPSC110.zip"
